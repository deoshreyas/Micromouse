# Micromouse

## :zap: About
This is my first robotics project! It is a simple autonomous maze-solving robot (Micromouse). Being a beginner project, I just used a simple left-wall following maze solving algorithm (explained below). 

## :books: The Algorithm
- Move forward if empty 
- If there is a wall in front, turn left 
- If cannot turn left, then turn right 

## :desktop_computer: How to reproduce the project
Just clone the repository on your machine, and upload the code to any sample Micromouse (there are several sample schematics available online!)
